The programm automaticly shuts down the computer when a Steam download is done.

The programm doens´t have a fancy overlay but it also doesn´t have to be configured at all.

What does the programm do?
1. waits untill a download is startet
2. waits untill a download is finished
3. wait another 3 minutes (steam has to compile the files) with a countdown
4. after the countdown is done the computer shuts down

note:
The programm was only testet on windows!
Please share bugs!
