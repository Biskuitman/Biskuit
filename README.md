The program automaticly shuts down the computer when a Steam download is done.
There is no fancy overlay but it works right out of the box.

What does the program do?
1. waits untill a download is started
2. waits untill a download is finished (it looks in the downloading folder in the Steam download)
3. wait another 3 minutes (steam has to compile the files) with a countdown
4. after the countdown is done the computer shuts down

note:
The program was only tested on windows!
Please share bugs!

Okay but how do I use it?
1. download asd.exe
2. start the program
3. start the download
4. done
